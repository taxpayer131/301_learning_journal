Today is the first day of 301.  Scott does things a bit different from Sam and Brian in 201, but that's neither good nor bad at this point.  I really like that Scott is flexible and allows us thus far to decide how to proceed on the semantics of how we get things done.

The only stressful part so far is deciding how to best manage my time.  Afternoon lectures are from 1pm until 4pm.  All times outside of lecture are for lab.  This will require a lot of adjustment on my part since I try to get home before 6pm most days to help out at home.  I hope that the pair programming doesn't backfire and leave me and my potential partners with very little time to get things done.  

Today went well with Isaac, one of my pair programming partners from 201 earlier this month.  Isaac and I work well together and were able to get today's lab done before 6pm.  I have to learn how to deal with my anxiety whenever dealing with deadlines.
